# embedded-systems-notebook
My personal collection of notes, tutorials, and projects to learn and explore low-level programming and computer systems. I’m diving into C and C++ fundamentals, operating systems, embedded development, and compilers to understand how software really talks to hardware

# RoadMap
  C Programming
    Read: The C Programming Language (K&R)
    Practice: Learn-C.org
    Do: CS50 
    Project: Rebuild printf, malloc, string lib
    Tool: Learn gcc, gdb, make

  C++ Programming
    Read: Programming Principles and Practice Using C++ – Stroustrup
    Watch: freeCodeCamp C++ Course
    Learn: OOP, RAII, STL, templates, smart pointers
    Project: CLI bank system, memory pool, smart pointer demo

  Systems Programming
    Read: The Linux Programming Interface – Kerrisk
    Learn: Processes, pipes, memory, signals, file I/O
    Tools: gdb, valgrind, strace, perf, lsof
    Project: Unix shell clone, custom malloc, file copier

  Operating Systems
    Read: Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces (OSTEP)
    Watch: MIT 6.S081
    Learn: Scheduling, virtual memory, page tables, syscalls
    Project: Paging simulator, xv6 mods, simple bootloader

  Compilers & Assembly
    Read: Crafting Interpreters – Bob Nystrom
    Watch: Stanford CS143
    Learn: Tokenizing, parsing, IR, codegen
    Project: Write a toy compiler → x86 or VM bytecode

  Tooling & Build Systems
    Learn: make, CMake, gdb, objdump, readelf
    Project: Convert C project to CMake, debug with gdb, profile with perf

  Final Projects to Showcase
    Unix shell in C
    Custom malloc() allocator
    Embedded-style UART driver (bare-metal C or C++)
    Paging/memory simulator
    Toy compiler or VM
